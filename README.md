 ### Details About Project:

  I built this using the MERN stack but also adding some features I have learned in the past.

  In addition to Mongo/Express/React/Node I'll using:
  - PassportJs for OAuth2.0 based authentication
  - Stripe for Payment Processing
  - SendGrid for Email Processing
  - GoogleOAuth
  - Redux
  - Heroku Deployment

  The working app allows users to when they visit our app to
  - Sign up via Google OAuth
  - Pay for email credits via Stripe ( not using recurring subscription service.  User will buy some # of credits to send out some # of emails)
  - User then creates a new "campaign"
  - User enters list of emails to send survey to
  - We send email to list of recipients
  - Recipients click on link in email to provide feedback
  - We tabulated feedback
  - User can see report of all survey responses
